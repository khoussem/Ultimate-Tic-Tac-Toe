The objective of the game is to win three big boxes in a row.
To win a big box, you must win three in a row of the smaller boxes
inside that big box. The first move can be made in any box. 
After that, the next players move must be inside the big box 
that correlates to the smaller box that was just played in.

After winning a box, the other player gets a freebee. 
That means they can play in any box they choose. If you send 
someone to a box that has already been the won, the next move 
will remain in the box the last player played in.
