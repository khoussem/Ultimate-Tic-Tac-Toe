Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe
====================

Sample board: There are nine boxes of regular tic-tac-toe games. The bottom middle box has been won by X so the whole thing is an X, all the other boards are currently in play.

            
 X | X | O I   |   |   I   |   |
---|---|---I---|---|---I---|---|---
   | O | X I   |   |   I   |   |  
---|---|---I---|---|---I---|---|---
   |   |   I   |   |   I   |   | 
===|===|===I===|===|===I===|===|===
   |   |   I   |   | O I   |   |
---|---|---I---|---|---I---|---|---
   |   |   I   | X |   I   |   |
---|---|---I---|---|---I---|---|---
   |   |   I   |   | O I   |   |
===|===|===I===|===|===I===|===|===
   |   |   I \ |   | / I   |   |
---|---|---I---\---/---I---|---|---
   |   |   I   | X |   I   |   |
---|---|---I---/---\---I---|---|---
   |   |   I / |   | \ I   |   |
   
           

Nine tic-tac-toe boards combined together, what else is it but ultimate? The objective is to win the smaller games of tic-tac-toe, which wins you that box. To win you simply need three smaller tic-tac-toe wins in a row. But playing the smaller games is more complicated than just tic-tac-toe, because all of the games are connected together.
